### CNN_Classifier_YOGA_Pose.ipynb
Last Updated: May 2019
Language: Python
Main Libraries: Keras, numpy
One of my first starter projects into deep learning and image recognition, I created a yoga classifier that takes in an image, and predicts which of 3 poses the person is in (garland, downward dog, reverse warrior).

Using a pretrained VGG model, I was able to achieve ~90% accuracy on a validation set using between 200-300 images for each class.
